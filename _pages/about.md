Hisham Sati comes to NYU Abu Dhabi from the University of Pittsburgh, where he supervised four PhD students and taught courses at all levels, including advanced graduate and research topics. Earlier, he was a Gibbs Assistant Professor at Yale University, a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland College Park, and a joint Research Associate at Australian National University and the University of Adelaide.

Sati was awarded grants from the US National Science Foundation and other sources for his interdisciplinary research on geometric aspects of physical theories. He has been a visiting researcher to various Math and Physics institutes around the world, including CERN in Geneva, MSRI in Berkeley, The Max Planck Institute in Bonn, The Erwin Schroedinger Institute in Vienna, IHES and IHP in Paris, and The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara.

He has co-organized several seminars, journal clubs, and over ten workshops and scientific meetings. His recent recognitions include delivering the Adams Memorial Lecture in Topology at the University of Manchester in 2016. Sati's publications range from pure physics to pure mathematics, but are mostly on the interactions between the two subjects, with physics being the motivation and source of interesting problems, whose solutions also lead to new and interesting mathematical structures and constructions.

At NYUAD, in addition to the capstone and undergraduate math courses, he teaches a core course on a topic which is at the heart of his research: "Theory of Everything".
